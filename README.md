# ezvn

A wrapper around svn to simplify some stuff.

## Build

To build you have to install the go language (golang), open a terminal, `cd` into the source directory and run:

```
go build .
```

This produces a binary called either `ezvn` or `ezvn.exe`. Put it into whatever path you desire and add the path to your systems `PATH` environment variable.

## Usage

After adding svn to the systems `PATH` environment variable, run `ezvn` to see the help output.
